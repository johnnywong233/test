/**
 * Demonstrates how {@code @Stepwise} causes a spec to be run in incremental steps.
 * Change a step's condition from {@literal true} to {@literal false}, and observe
 * how the remaining steps will be skipped automatically on the next run.
 * Also notice that if you run a single step (e.g. from the IDE's context menu),
 * all prior steps will also be run.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Stepwise} is particularly useful for higher-level specs whose
 * methods have logical dependencies.
